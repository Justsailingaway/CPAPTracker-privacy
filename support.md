## Need Help?

We're here to help you get the most out of CPAP Tracker. Below you'll find answers to common questions and ways to reach us.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General

**What is CPAP Tracker?**
CPAP Tracker helps you manage your CPAP equipment by tracking replacement schedules, cleaning tasks, logging AHI values, and optionally viewing sleep data from Apple Health.

**Is my data stored online?**
By default, all data is stored locally on your device. Pro users can optionally enable iCloud sync to keep data synchronized across multiple devices. When enabled, your data is stored in your private iCloud account—we never have access to it.

### Equipment Tracking

**How do I add a new consumable?**
Go to the Consumables tab and tap the "+" button. Select the type of consumable and set a replacement interval.

**What does "Due Soon" and "Overdue" mean?**
- **Due Soon**: The consumable is within 20% of its replacement date.
- **Overdue**: The replacement date has passed. Tap the consumable to replace it.

**Can I track more than 5 consumables?**
The free version supports up to 5 consumables. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited tracking.

### AHI Tracking

**What is AHI?**
AHI (Apnea-Hypopnea Index) is a measurement from your CPAP machine that indicates the number of breathing interruptions per hour of sleep. Lower is better—under 5 is considered normal.

**How do I log my AHI?**
Go to the Sleep tab and tap "Log AHI" to enter your value from your CPAP machine's display or app. You can include usage hours and notes.

**Where can I find my AHI?**
Most CPAP machines display AHI on the screen when you wake up. You can also find it in your machine's companion app (like myAir for ResMed or DreamMapper for Philips).

### Sleep Data

**How do I see my sleep data?**
Go to the Sleep tab. The app reads sleep data from Apple Health. You'll need to grant HealthKit permission when prompted.

**What if I don't have sleep data?**
You can preview the feature using example data. Go to Settings and look for the "Example Sleep Data" section.

**Why isn't my sleep data showing?**
Make sure HealthKit access is enabled: go to iOS Settings > Health > Data Access & Devices > CPAP Tracker and enable sleep data access.

### XP, Streaks & Achievements

**How do I earn XP?**
You earn experience points (XP) by:
- Replacing consumables on time
- Completing cleaning tasks
- Logging your AHI regularly
- Maintaining streaks

**What are streaks?**
Streaks track your consistency. You have separate streaks for equipment replacement and AHI logging. Keep them going to earn bonus XP and unlock achievements!

**What happens if I miss a day?**
Your current streak resets, but your longest streak record is preserved. You can always start building a new streak.

### Cleaning

**How does the cleaning schedule work?**
The Cleaning tab shows daily, weekly, and monthly tasks based on the consumables you're tracking. Tap a task to mark it complete and earn XP.

### iCloud Sync (Pro)

**How do I enable iCloud sync?**
Go to Settings and toggle on "iCloud Sync." Your data will sync across all devices signed into the same iCloud account.

**What data syncs?**
Consumables, replacement history, cleaning records, AHI entries, XP, streaks, and achievements all sync. App settings and HealthKit data do not sync.

**What if I have data on multiple devices?**
When you enable sync, the app intelligently merges your data. It keeps your highest XP total and longest streaks from any device.

**How do I turn off sync?**
Go to Settings and toggle off "iCloud Sync." Your data stays on each device but stops syncing new changes.

### Pro Upgrade

**What does Pro include?**
- Unlimited consumables
- iCloud sync across devices
- PDF export of your equipment history
- Ad-free experience
- All future Pro features

**Is Pro a subscription?**
No. Pro is a one-time purchase with lifetime access.

**How do I restore my purchase?**
Go to Settings > tap "Upgrade to Pro" > tap "Restore Purchases" at the bottom of the paywall.

### Notifications

**How do I set up reminders?**
The app will ask for notification permission on first launch. You can manage notifications in iOS Settings > Notifications > CPAP Tracker.

### Data Management

**How do I export my data?**
Pro users can export a PDF report from Settings. This includes your consumables and replacement history.

**How do I delete all my data?**
Go to Settings and use "Reset All Data" to permanently delete everything. If you use iCloud sync, you may also need to delete data from your iCloud settings.
