# Privacy Policy for CPAP Tracker

**Last Updated:** February 3, 2026

## Overview

CPAP Tracker ("the App") is designed to help users manage their CPAP equipment replacement schedules, track cleaning tasks, monitor sleep therapy progress, and maintain healthy CPAP usage habits. This privacy policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your choices regarding your information.

## Data We Collect

### Equipment & Cleaning Data
The App collects and stores the following data to provide its core functionality:
- CPAP consumable items (masks, tubing, filters, etc.) and replacement schedules
- Cleaning task completion records and notes
- Replacement history and dates
- Notification preferences for reminders

This data is stored locally on your device by default and is never transmitted to our servers.

### Health Data

**Apple HealthKit Integration:**
- With your permission, the App reads sleep analysis data from Apple Health, including sleep duration, sleep stages, and time in bed
- The App may also read respiratory rate and oxygen saturation data if available
- This data is displayed within the App but is **not stored separately** — it remains in Apple Health
- The App does not write data to Apple Health

**Manual AHI Tracking:**
- You may manually log your Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) values from your CPAP machine
- AHI entries include the date, AHI value, usage hours, and optional notes
- This data is stored locally on your device and optionally synced via iCloud (Pro feature)

### Gamification Data
To encourage consistent equipment maintenance, the App tracks:
- Experience points (XP) earned from completing tasks
- Current and longest streaks for equipment replacement and AHI logging
- Achievements and badges unlocked

This data is stored locally and optionally synced via iCloud for Pro users.

### Advertising Data
For users of the free version, the App displays advertisements through Google AdMob. AdMob may collect:
- Device identifiers (including Advertising Identifier if you grant permission)
- IP address and general location
- App usage and interaction data
- Ad performance metrics

You can opt out of personalized advertising through your iOS Settings (Privacy & Security > Tracking).

### App Preferences
The App stores your preferences locally, including:
- Sleep goal settings
- Notification schedules and preferences
- Display preferences
- iCloud sync settings

## How Data Is Stored

### Local Storage (Default)
All your data is stored locally on your device in a secure database within an App Group container. This data is protected by your device's built-in security features, including encryption when your device is locked.

### iCloud Sync (Optional, Pro Feature)
Pro subscribers can optionally enable iCloud sync to keep data synchronized across multiple devices. When enabled:
- Data is stored in your private iCloud account using Apple's CloudKit service
- Synced data includes: consumables, cleaning records, replacement history, AHI entries, gamification progress, and achievements
- Data is encrypted in transit and at rest by Apple
- Only you can access your synced data — we cannot access your iCloud data
- You can disable sync at any time in the App's Settings

**Data Merge Behavior:** When syncing across devices, the App intelligently merges your data to prevent loss. For example, it keeps your highest XP total and longest streaks from any device.

### Widget Data Sharing
The App includes a home screen widget that displays your consumable status. The widget accesses the same local database as the main App through a shared App Group container. No additional data is collected for the widget.

## Third-Party Services

### Google AdMob
The free version of the App displays advertisements provided by Google AdMob. Google's privacy policy applies to data collected through ads: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

### SKAdNetwork Partners
The App includes SKAdNetwork identifiers for 49 advertising partners to enable privacy-preserving ad attribution on iOS 14 and later. This allows ad networks to measure campaign effectiveness without accessing your personal information. SKAdNetwork is Apple's privacy-focused framework that does not share personally identifiable information with advertisers.

### Apple Services
The App integrates with the following Apple services:
- **HealthKit:** To read sleep and respiratory data (with your permission)
- **CloudKit:** To sync data across your devices (Pro feature, optional)
- **StoreKit:** To process Pro subscription purchases
- **App Tracking Transparency:** To request permission for personalized ads

Apple's privacy policy applies to these services: [https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/)

## In-App Purchases

The App offers a Pro subscription that unlocks additional features including unlimited consumables, iCloud sync, PDF export, and an ad-free experience. All purchases are processed by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect or store your payment information. Your purchase history is managed by Apple and can be viewed in your App Store account settings.

## Your Rights & Choices

### Export Your Data
Pro subscribers can export a PDF report of their equipment and replacement history from the Settings screen.

### Delete Your Data
You can delete all your data at any time using the "Reset All Data" option in Settings. This permanently removes all consumables, cleaning records, replacement history, AHI entries, and gamification progress from your device. If iCloud sync is enabled, you may also need to delete data from iCloud via your device's iCloud settings.

### Control iCloud Sync
You can enable or disable iCloud sync at any time in Settings. Disabling sync does not delete existing data — it simply stops syncing new changes. Your data remains on each device where it was previously synced.

### Manage Permissions
You can revoke or modify the App's permissions at any time:
- **HealthKit:** Settings > Health > Data Access & Devices > CPAP Tracker
- **Notifications:** Settings > CPAP Tracker > Notifications
- **Tracking:** Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking

### Disable Personalized Ads
You can opt out of personalized advertising by:
1. Going to iOS Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking
2. Disabling "Allow Apps to Request to Track"
3. Or denying tracking permission when prompted by the App

You will still see ads, but they will not be personalized to your interests. Alternatively, upgrade to Pro for an ad-free experience.

## Data Security

We take data security seriously:
- All data is stored locally on your device, protected by iOS security features
- iCloud data is encrypted by Apple in transit and at rest
- We do not operate servers that store your personal data
- We cannot access your local or iCloud data

## Data Retention

- **Local data** is retained until you delete it or uninstall the App
- **iCloud data** is retained in your iCloud account until you delete it or disable sync
- **Advertising data** is retained according to Google's data retention policies

## Children's Privacy

CPAP Tracker is not intended for use by children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.

## International Users

Your data is stored locally on your device and, if you enable iCloud sync, in Apple's data centers according to Apple's data residency policies. Google AdMob may transfer advertising data internationally according to Google's policies.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any changes.
